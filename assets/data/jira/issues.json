Screensharing is also required. \n\nWe should contact all the local network providers to see if they have preferred services that work with their networks.",
    "As an employee I'd need to understand the rules and regulations of Beyond Gravity while working at the company on Mars. \n\nIn general, rules should be the same as they are on Earth unless local rules on Mars prohibit otherwise. Please file any discrepancies in JIRA so that we can review them and make decisions that work for our Martian colleagues.",

When I request user details using our REST API we should include travel details. \n\nThe URL is: \nhttp://staging.beyondgravity.team/rest/api/2/user/UserID \n\nWe should return all trips in the past three years with: \n* Trip ID \n* Trip Title \n* Date of Trip \n\nWe can then pass the trip id to \nhttp://staging.beyondgravity.team/rest/api/2/reservation/ to get further trip details.",
    "As part of the Saturn Summer Sizzle we'd like to have feedback from prior travelers to Saturn. \n\nWe can use a mixture of text and video content, but we need about 5 travelers that can contribute to the Beyond Gravity website. We'd like to focus our potential customers as to why Saturn is the destination of choice for them.",

    "Now that Pluto is no longer a planet, there is increased demand to see Pluto out in space. \n\nPlease research options for travel to Pluto so we can see if it's the right market for Beyond Gravity to move into. Also consider local travel partners with whom we might be able to network in the area.",
    "We have found that many group tours need a way to efficiently transport the entire team between the airport and hotel, travel between the hotel and local destinations, as well as book traditional tours. \n\nMars is our largest market in the inner Solar System. Phobos and Deimos Tours is an all location provider in the local area. Let's engage them on the SeeSpaceEZ booking system.",
    "Beyond Gravity is looking to work with a few key travel providers for our annual Summer Saturn Sizzle. The Red Titan Hotel has been a popular destination because of it's views of Saturn. They don't handle large groups well though. \n\nWe should negotiate preferred pricing as well as evangelize the SeeSpaceEZ platform to help them scale with us.",
    "We need to build strategic relationship with space carriers to negotiate preferred travel discounts for our customers. \n\nJupiter Express is a new discount travel provider that specializes in outer solar system travel. This market has typically been held by the luxury carriers but Jupiter Express has good service to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. \n\nJupiter Express can also be a key travel partner for the Saturn Summer Sale. Let's see if we can get them on the SeeSpaceEZ Travel Platform.",
    "We need to build strategic relationship with space carriers to negotiate preferred travel discounts for our customers. \n\nThere is strong demand to see the Sun in a day tour from Earth. SunSpot Tours has regular service from Earth and the Moon to see the Sun. Let's see if we can get them on the SeeSpaceEZ Travel Platform.",
    "We need to build strategic relationship with space carriers to negotiate preferred travel discounts for our customers. \n\nJetShuttle SpaceWays has great service from Asia and Europe to the moon as well as the inner solar system. They fill a gap in our portfolio for inner solar system travel from Europe. \n\nLet's see if we can get them on the See Space EZ Travel Platform.",
    "A number of our users engage with us at blogs.beyondgravity.team. We should have a blog post that is the target for our email campaign announcing the Summer Saturn Sale. \n\nThe blog should feature our new travel partners on the SeeSpaceEZ travel platform and showcase how we make space travel easy for teams.",
    "The summer travel season is coming up and we need to let our customers know about our targeted sale to Saturn. Saturn's sheer beauty make it an exciting travel destinations. \n\nThe email campaign should focus on deep discounts on fares as well as accommodations. Groups of over 20 people save extra on both airfare and hotel stays. \n\nSee [~kowens] for more details.",
    "Our clients need an easy way to transport large groups between: \n* Airport and Hotel \n* Hotel and group venues like a large group dinner or offsite \n* Traditional Tours \n\nSaturn Shuttle Lines seems to be the right provider to engage on the SeeSpaceEZ platform. Our initial reviews indicate they have the right level of local knowledge and charisma with our clients.",
    "Beyond Gravity has found that some individuals prefer to see Saturn on their own instead of being on a large tour group. Initial talks with Speedy seem to indicate that they are a good candidate for working with Beyond Gravity. \n\nGoal is to enable them to work with us on the SeeSpaceEZ booking system so individuals can book personal travel in conjunction with their group tour.",
    "Beyond Gravity is looking to work with a few key travel providers for our annual Summer Saturn Sizzle. Saturn's Rings Resort has been a popular destination and is able to handle larger groups on short notice. \n\nWe should negotiate preferred pricing with them as part of the Beyond Gravity Preferred Provider Program",
    "Our Mars office will need many of the same supplies available on Earth: \n* Chairs \n* Desks \n* Pens/Paper \n\nWe should establish a strategic relationship with one of the local vendors to give us preferred pricing rather than buying everything as needed at full retail price.",
    "As a company we will have the same meal service on Mars as we do on earth. Meal service should include: \n# Free beverages and snacks throughout the day \n# Free breakfast and lunch \n## Both meals should include a protein \n## Vegetarian options should be available \n# Dinner will be a subsidized program at 50% of typical outside cost",
    "After we get our Mars Tax ID number, the company needs to integrate Mars' tax code into the system. Mars has differing tax codes based on the employee's location, so we will likely require an update from our payroll vendor.",
    "As a business we need to have a relationship with the Mars Ministry of Revenue such that we can withhold taxes from our employees for tax purposes.",
    "To ensure a smooth rollout and to have company goals for our Mars office clearly communicated, we need to ensure that each department has 90 day plans. \n\nEach 90 day plan needs to have 3-5 goals that are aggressive, but attainable for the teams to meet. Each plan should list out any resources required from the main office here on Earth.",
    "As a business entity we need to register with the Mars Ministry of Labor to ensure we can operate legally on the planet of Mars as well as pay our employees.",
    "When I search for a hotel using our new API: \n\nI'm not seeing the hotel name. Example JSON follows \n\n{code} \n{ \n\"id\":\"39001\", \n\"hotel\":\"\", \n\"location\":\"Saturn\" \n} \n{code}",
    "When we deploy a SeeSpaceEZ Plus server in cloud after about 100,000 requests we see that the server runs out of memory and crashes. The cloud platform recognizes this and regenerates a new server, but we need to understand why we have so many servers dying. \n\nWe've not seen this issue in the SeeSpaceEZ platform. It seems to be related to the new code. We started seeing this issue about 6 hours ago.",
    "When looking up flight details the speed of that call has now gone over 5 seconds. We'd like this call to typically take 2-3 seconds. Given our expansion over the past few months, I see the performance issues in the database. \n\nWe should review all the indexes for the flight tables and run a slow query search to see if we can track down any performance concerns.",
    "When I request reservation using our REST API I get a 500 error. \n\nThe URL is: \nhttp://staging.beyondgravity.team/rest/api/2/reservation/99808 \n\nIt seems to be specific to this reservation as other reservations do not experience this error.",
